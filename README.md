# AAM
African Animal Migration

## Inspiration
Are animals better at weather forecasting than human beings?

## What it does
Study of Impact of Weather Precipitation on Animal Migration-Kruger Buffalo
We extracted data of landcover, migration of elephants and precipitation, then used QGIS to visualise them trying to see the relationship of these information.

## How I built it
QGIS

## Challenges I ran into
Extract netcdf datasets from ECMWF server directly

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Learned how to use GIS

## What I learned
QGIS
How to extract data from ECMWF
Having fun

## What's next for African Animals Migration
Develop more details and consider more attributes that may influence the migration of animals.
Analyse the weather and landcover to predict the optimal route of migration and help animals move to prevent from extinction.
